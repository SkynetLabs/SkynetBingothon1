There is an issue for each of the Bingo squares with a description for the skapp. Skapps must meet a standard of *acceptable* to be eligible for a prize. To write an acceptable skapp, it must be a completed, quality, fun to use application, and it must be [Homescreen compatible](https://docs.siasky.net/integrations/homescreen/adding-homescreen-support-to-an-app). The judges will primarily be asking whether the skapp has any major eyesores, bugs, or UX hurdles that would turn away users. Hackers are encouraged to build the minimal app possible, without cutting corners on professionalism. [SkySend](https://skysend.hns.siasky.net) is a fantastic example of a skapp that is minimal, yet provides excellent user experience.

Apps can be submitted at any time. Judges will either accept the app or provide detailed feedback indicating why an app was not accepted. Hackers can resubmit the application with no penalty once they have addressed any issues. Tag @taek and @ayoung on the Bingothon thread in [Discord](https://discord.gg/skynetlabs) when you are ready to submit. We will do our best to be prompt with our responses!

You can earn awards in three ways. 
1. Win a square by being the first to submit an acceptable MVP. (1 per square)
2. Submit an acceptable skapp after the winning project (split the pool prize with all other winners)
3. A square you've won is a part of a bingo (horizontal or vertical) (adds to the pool prize).

Awards are as follows:

|         Win Type          | Prize Amount (in Siacoin) |
|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
|1. Square-winning skapp     |      $400 USD        |
| 2. Prize pool per square |       $400 USD        |
|  3.  Square is part of a bingo  |         $400 USD x 2       |

There are no limits to the number of squares you can submit a skapp for. A full one half of the potential prize money comes from completing Bingos - work together with your fellow hackers to divide-and-conquer! You can coordinate on [Discord](https://discord.gg/skynetlabs). 

We hope you have fun hacking, and good luck!
